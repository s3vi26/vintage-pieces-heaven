A boilerplate for all your react and express needs! It was created with create-react-app and then ejected so you have more control over webpack features if needed!

SASS has now been integrated into the boilerplate for a more flexible experience.

All the same commands still work, such as yarn start and yarn build.

Use yarn start to run your local development hot reloading while simultaneously running nodemon server.js in another terminal window to have access to fully functional API routes.

Once your server is up, run http://localhost:8080/ping and you should receive the response pong.
